 * Onboarding is admin-only (the backend gates it behind `config:write`), so
 * non-admins can't run the wizard. Instead of the onboarding flow, they see
 * this "contact your administrator" screen. It renders inside the same card
 * shell as the onboarding wizard (see `chat-renderer.tsx`), so it inherits the
 * wizard's container sizing and entrance animation — this component only needs
 * to fill that card and center its content.
