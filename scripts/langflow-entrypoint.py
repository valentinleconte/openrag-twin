"""Entrypoint for the OpenRAG Langflow container.

Runs as root to correct /app/langflow-data bind-mount permissions, then drops
to uid/gid 1000 (langflow user) before exec-ing the main process.

On macOS with Podman the virtiofs layer does not faithfully propagate
host-side chmod into the container, so permissions must be fixed from
inside the container after the mount is established.
