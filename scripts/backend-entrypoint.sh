# backend-entrypoint.sh — run as root, fix volume-mount ownership, then drop to appuser.
#
# When Docker (not Podman) mounts a host directory the ownership reflects the
# host filesystem, which may not be UID/GID 1000. Podman handles this with the
# :U compose flag; this script is the belt-and-suspenders fallback for Docker
# and any other runtime that does not remap UIDs automatically.
#
# Each path listed below corresponds to a volume mount in docker-compose.yml.
# The chown is a no-op when the directory is already owned by appuser (e.g.
# fresh Podman start), so there is no cost to running this unconditionally.
