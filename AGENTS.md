# Agent Instructions

This repository ships with **agent skills** that any compliant agent can use to help users install OpenRAG, integrate the OpenRAG SDK, and run the local dev stack. The canonical skill files are markdown with YAML frontmatter (the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) format), and live under `plugins/openrag/skills/`.

## Available skills

| Skill | File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openrag_install` | [`plugins/openrag/skills/install/SKILL.md`](plugins/openrag/skills/install/SKILL.md) | Plan and execute a minimal OpenRAG installation, verify locally. |
| `openrag_sdk` | [`plugins/openrag/skills/sdk/SKILL.md`](plugins/openrag/skills/sdk/SKILL.md) | Guide SDK integration (Python, TypeScript, MCP) with code examples. |
| `openrag_dev_stack` | [`plugins/openrag/skills/dev-stack/SKILL.md`](plugins/openrag/skills/dev-stack/SKILL.md) | Start, monitor, restart, or stop the local dev stack (Docker infra + host backend + host frontend). |

## How to use these skills

Pick the path that matches your agent runtime.

### Claude Code (this repo)

`.claude/skills/` symlinks into the plugin, so after cloning the repo the skills are auto-discovered by Claude Code — invoke with `/install`, `/sdk`, or `/dev-stack`, or let Claude trigger them automatically based on the description fields.

### Claude Code (install globally, any repo)

```
/plugin marketplace add langflow-ai/openrag
/plugin install openrag@openrag
```

### Claude Agent SDK / other skill-aware runtimes

Point your skill loader at `plugins/openrag/skills/`. Each subdirectory is one skill.

### Any other agent (generic)

Read the `SKILL.md` files directly. The frontmatter `description` tells you when the skill is relevant; the body is the instruction set to follow.

## Skill authoring notes

- Skill bodies are intentionally kept agent-neutral. Do not add references to tools or features that only exist in one runtime (for example, do not name specific slash commands, hook systems, or task-tracking tools).
- Claude-Code-specific plumbing belongs in `plugin.json` or `.claude/`, not in `SKILL.md`.
- See `plugins/README.md` for the full layout and distribution model.

## Operational constraints

**Single-worker only (until Redis cache lands).** The RBAC permission cache and OAuth-subject→DB-id cache are both per-process (`cachetools.TTLCache`). Running with multiple uvicorn workers or multiple helm replicas means a role grant or revoke takes effect in only one process; the others serve stale permissions for up to `OPENRAG_PERM_CACHE_TTL` seconds (default 60). The startup event in `src/main.py` enforces `UVICORN_WORKERS<=1` and `CACHE_BACKEND=memory` and hard-fails otherwise. To horizontally scale, swap the cache to Redis first.

**RBAC is opt-in.** `OPENRAG_RBAC_ENFORCE` defaults to `false`, which makes OpenRAG behave like the pre-RBAC release: every authenticated user has full access; API-key role overrides are also bypassed. To turn the permissions system on (admin/developer/user/viewer roles, `require_permission` gates, audit denials), set `OPENRAG_RBAC_ENFORCE=true`. Available in all `OPENRAG_RUN_MODE` values — operators own the trade-off. The startup event logs the enforcement state on every boot.

**Dev-local with backend on host.** When you run `make dev-local-cpu` (or `dev-local`) and then `make backend` on the host, OpenSearch needs to resolve `openrag-backend` to the host machine so it can fetch JWKS for OIDC validation. Langflow also needs that name for backend ingest callbacks. The base `docker-compose.yml` does NOT add this alias — it would break CI, where the backend is a docker-compose service. To enable the host-backend mode, layer the override file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.host-backend.yml up -d opensearch dashboards langflow
make backend     # in another terminal
make frontend    # in another terminal
```

The override only adds `extra_hosts: openrag-backend:host-gateway` to the OpenSearch and Langflow services. Without it, OIDC and ingest callbacks work because docker DNS routes `openrag-backend` to the in-compose backend container.
