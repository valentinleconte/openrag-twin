"""Session ownership — replaces ``data/session_ownership.json``.

Maps a chat session_id (== response_id) to the owning user. Used for
access-control checks: only the owning user can read/release a session.

The user_id column is intentionally NOT a foreign key — legacy JSON
state may reference user_ids that haven't been backfilled into the
``users`` table yet, and we don't want migration to fail on FK
violations.
