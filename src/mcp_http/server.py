"""
FastMCP streamable HTTP server integration.

Exposes all /v1/ FastAPI endpoints as MCP tools over streamable HTTP transport.
Auth headers passed by MCP clients are forwarded to the underlying FastAPI
endpoint handlers via FastMCP's internal proxy.

IMPORTANT: FastMCP's proxy STRIPS the ``Authorization`` header before invoking
the /v1 handler (it is in get_http_headers()'s exclude set), so neither an
``Authorization`` JWT nor ``Authorization: Bearer orag_...`` survives the proxy.
Use ``X-API-Key`` for API keys. For SaaS/IBM auth, the gateway (Traefik)
authenticates the X-Username/X-Api-Key pair and injects the minted user JWT into
the add-on ``X-OpenRAG-API-JWT`` header (OPENRAG_API_JWT_HEADER), which FastMCP
forwards because it is not in the exclude set; the /v1 auth dependency reads it.

Supported authentication methods:

1. OpenRAG API Key:
   - X-API-Key: orag_...

2. IBM Auth (when IBM_AUTH_ENABLED=true):
   - X-Username: <ibm_username>
   - X-Api-Key: <ibm_api_key>
   The gateway exchanges these for a user JWT placed in X-OpenRAG-API-JWT.

Usage (MCP client config):

    Standard API key:
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "openrag": {
          "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
          "headers": { "X-API-Key": "orag_..." }
        }
      }
    }

    IBM auth:
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "openrag": {
          "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "X-Username": "your_ibm_username",
            "X-Api-Key": "your_ibm_api_key"
          }
