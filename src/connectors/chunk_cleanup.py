"""Single deletion path for a connector file's indexed chunks.

Deletion propagation has multiple *triggers* — orphan reconciliation (file
missing from a full remote listing), per-file 404 cleanup during sync, rename
cleanup — but exactly one deletion *semantic*, owned here:

* Chunks are matched by the stable connector file id against BOTH id layouts:
  the standard ingest path stores it in ``connector_file_id`` (``document_id``
  holds the content hash), the Langflow path stores it in ``document_id``.
  Matching a single field misses chunks from the other layout.
* Optionally owner-scoped: ``owner_user_id`` restricts to that owner's chunks;
  ``shared=True`` targets ownerless (instance-shared) chunks instead.
* DLS-safe: visible chunk ``_id``s are enumerated with the caller's
  (user-scoped) client, then deleted individually with the trusted backend
  write client — ``delete_by_query`` is silently no-opped under DLS.
