"""sync_specific_files must not drop IDs of files deleted at the source.

Webhook delete events arrive as bare file IDs. `sync_specific_files`
re-expands IDs via the connector's `list_files()`, which only returns files
that still exist — so deleted IDs used to vanish from the batch (and a
delete-only batch raised "No files to sync after expanding folders"). The
fix re-adds requested IDs that are missing after expansion (excluding known
folders), so `ConnectorFileProcessor` can run its deleted-at-source cleanup
(get_file_content -> 404 -> delete indexed chunks).
